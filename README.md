# A11y Checklist / Test Specification

¬© 2024 [Access for all](https://access-for-all.ch/) (A4a), on behalf of the [Federal Office for the Equality of Persons with Disabilities](https://www.edi.admin.ch/ebgb) (EBGB)

An initiative of [Allianz Digitale Inklusion Schweiz](https://www.adis.ch/) (ADIS).

## Summary

TODO: Update for this branch!

This project consists of two parts:

- The **üìú Accessibility Checklist** is a succinct yet comprehensive summary of the [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)'s success criteria (version 2.2, levels A and AA). It aims to make those contents more tangible to parties involved in producing websites (designers, developers, and content creators, among others). In addition to explanatory text, it provides basic examples (in text and code form), links to official and other high quality resources, as well as so called checkpoints: general instructions which help to be aware of the most common accessibility issues, and to test them with pragmatic tools.
- The **‚úÖ Test Specification** is an addition to the checklist: it extends each checkpoint with detailed test steps, adds many more "real life" examples (in text form), provides screenshots of such, and explains regularly used tools, techniques, concepts, etc. (so called üè∑Ô∏è tags). Currently, the focus lies on Web accessibility, but there are plans to extend the scope to Mobile accessibility (web, native, and hybrid), as well as PDF.

All this aims to disclose the decades long experience of A4a's team: it establishes transparency on our daily workflows and offers both theoretical knowledge and practical advice that stood the test of time.

## Release status

Both the **üìú Accessibility Checklist** and the **‚úÖ Test Specification** are ready to be published. These are "living documents" and will be updated regularly to reflect newest insights; collaboration with the accessibility community is encouraged.

These documents will be used to generate documentation, i. e. the successor to the [Accessibility Checkliste 2.1](https://a11y.digitaldialog.swiss/) (alpha).

## Source format

### Files and folders

The folder structure reflects the WCAG.

### Contents

All multi-line content is written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). We use only default syntax, so no additional extensions should be needed.

### Screenshots

- Due to technical limitations, screenshots currently are in (highly compressed) PNG format.
- The screenshot files are located in the related checkpoint's folder, in a sub folder `images`.
