# ðŸ“œ 3.2.4 Consistent Identification - AA

## Understanding (short)

**Similar elements** must be **implemented consistently** within a website. This enables optimal interaction with them.

## Understanding (long)

For web pages to work in a predictable way, similar elements within a website must appear and behave in the same way. This is particularly important for people with cognitive disabilities.

For example, elements should be named consistently, icons (e.g. for printing, downloading) should be used consistently, and JavaScript widgets should behave in the same way.

**Note:** Especially in larger projects with multiple contributors, the same element may be implemented by different parties. Make sure that the implementations behave identically.

### Responsibilities

- The design team defines interactive elements that look and behave consistently.
- The development team correctly implements the specifications defined by the design team.
- Clients should be aware that in large projects, special care must be taken to ensure that the same elements are implemented identically by all participants.

## Examples

The search function is always structured and labelled in the same way on all pages.
