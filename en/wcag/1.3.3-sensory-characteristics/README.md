# ðŸ“œ 1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics - A

## Understanding (short)

**Instructions** must be communicated in a way that **does not rely on a single sensory perception** (e.g., color vision). This ensures that people who lack this sensory ability can still process all instructions.

## Understanding (long)

A person with colour deficiency can do little with the instruction 'Correct the red marked fields'. A blind person will not understand the instructions 'Look at the right column' or 'Click on the square icon'. A hearing-impaired person cannot perceive acoustic signals (e.g. a warning tone for incorrect entries).

This circumstance can be taken into account by offering additional stimuli on other sensory channels, e.g. 'Correct the fields marked in red and with exclamation marks' or 'See right column "Explanations"' (however, a reference to the position within the order of a document is permissible, e.g. 'above', 'below', 'following', etc., see also [ðŸ“œ-1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence](/en/wcag/1.3.2-meaningful-sequence)). For auditory signals, always provide a visual cue.

**Note:** For requirements relating to information conveyed by colour alone, see guideline ðŸ“œ-1.4.

### Responsibilities

- The design team always defines an alternative for information that relies on a specific sensory ability.
- The development team implements the specifications defined by the design team.
- The content team formulates the content in an accessible way, so that understanding does not depend solely on reference to a single sensory ability.

## Examples

Incorrect input fields in a form are not only outlined in red, but also labelled as incorrect with a clear symbol (e.g. an exclamation mark).

## âœ… Checkpoints
