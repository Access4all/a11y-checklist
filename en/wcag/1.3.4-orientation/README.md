# ðŸ“œ 1.3.4 Orientation - AA

## Understanding (short)

**Content** must be able to be displayed and operated in both portrait and landscape format**. This allows you to decide for yourself which format is preferred.

## Understanding (long)

People with certain disabilities work with a fixed output device, such as a smartphone attached to a wheelchair (physically mounted in a holder). It is not possible for them to rotate the device. People with severe visual impairments may prefer the smartphone to be oriented in a horizontally oriented position, as content may appear larger. It is therefore important that web content can be viewed and operated in both portrait and landscape formats.

If the content does not automatically adjust to the screen orientation, a switch must be provided to manually rotate the screen content. For websites, this is provided by the browser, see also [ðŸ“œ-1.4.10 Reflow](/en/wcag/1.4.10-reflow). For mobile applications, the implementation is the responsibility of the design and development team.

**Exceptions:** Use cases where a specific screen orientation is required (e.g. a piano app that requires landscape format to display enough keys, or where the required number of keys would be too small to display in portrait format).

### Responsibilities

- The design team defines views that can be displayed and used in both landscape and portrait formats.
- The development team correctly implements the design team's specifications and ensures that all content is correctly displayed and usable in both screen orientations.
