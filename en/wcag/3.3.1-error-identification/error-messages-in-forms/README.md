# âœ… Error messages in forms

Wcag criterion: [ðŸ“œ 3.3.1 Error Identification - A](..)

## Description

Error messages in forms are implemented barrier-free: input errors can be experienced on different perception channels (e.g. not only visually, but also with a screen reader) and the corresponding input fields can be identified.

## Method

Interact with the form and check whether errors can also be experienced with a screen reader and whether faulty elements can be identified.

## Details on web applicability (specific test steps)

ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Currently only available in German.
