# 1.3.1 Info and Relationships - A

## Understanding (short)

**Information components** that belong together must be programmed in such a way that their relationships to each other are not only visual, but can also be clearly determined **in the code**. This enables assistive technologies (e.g. screen readers) to capture information structures and offer them in non-visual form.

## Understanding (long)

Sighted users perceive structure and relationships through various visual cues: headings are capitalised and bold; list items are introduced by a bullet point and indented; paragraphs are separated by a blank line; form fields have labels and can be grouped and framed with a common label; a specific background colour can be used to indicate that multiple items are related; certain words can be bolded, italicised or underlined; and so on.

Such visual cues must also be represented in the code by appropriate **semantics** so that the information important for understanding is perceptible to all.

### Contains sub-success criteria

This success criterion 1.3.1 is very extensive. In addition to the checkpoints that are directly included, there are further checkpoints in the sub-success criteria:

- **ðŸ“œ-1.3.1a Headings structure**: Headline structure
- **ðŸ“œ-1.3.1b Use of Lists**: Enumerations and lists
- **ðŸ“œ-1.3.1c Forms, Labels and Fieldsets**: Form relationships
- **ðŸ“œ-1.3.1d Tabular data**: Tabular data
- **ðŸ“œ-1.3.1e Proper Semantic Markup**: Semantically correct markup

**Important:** This division of success criteria into sub-success criteria does **not** exist in the original WCAG. It is a measure to promote the clarity of the WCAG.
