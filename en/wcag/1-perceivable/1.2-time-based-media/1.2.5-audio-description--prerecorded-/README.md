# 1.2.5 Audio Description (Prerecorded) - AA

## Understanding (short)

For **recorded videos with audio** (such as feature films), an **audio description** must be available, which also describes purely visual actions that are relevant to the content. This enables people with visual impairments to also be able to process this purely visual information.

## Understanding (long)

Add audio descriptions to all videos whose visual information is not already available in the audio track. An audio description is an edited version of the audio track that provides more information than the original. This is typically information that would otherwise only be conveyed visually.

**Important:** The audio description makes a text transcript optional. This means that this success criterion also automatically fulfils ðŸ“œ-1.2.3.

**Tip:** If the voice output of a video announces all relevant information (e.g. the commentator in a documentary), audio description becomes superfluous; this is significantly more cost-effective and could be included as a recommendation in any editorial guidelines. A feature film, on the other hand, often relies on subtle visual details, the meaning of which blind people miss without audio description.

### Responsibilities

- The development team creates the necessary technical requirements, such as the ability to switch between the normal audio track and the audio description.
- The content managers create and maintain the relevant content as required.
- Clients should be aware that the creation of accessible audio and video content entails additional work.

## Examples

- A video player has a menu for selecting the language. For each language, there is also an option to select the corresponding audio description (e.g. 'German' and 'German with audio description').
- For example, the scene in a crime thriller in which an attacker with a knife silently approaches someone is audio-described as follows: 'A stooped figure with a knife in his hand sneaks up behind the inspector'.
