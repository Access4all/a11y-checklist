# 1.2.2 Captions (Prerecorded) - A

## Understanding (short)

**Subtitles** must be available for **recorded videos with audio** (such as feature films). This enables people with hearing impairments to process speech as well.

## Understanding (long)

Add subtitles to all videos with speech. Describe the words spoken and identify the speakers. Also describe non-speech, auditory information (e.g. meaningful sounds).

**Note:** You do not need to provide an alternative if the element itself is already an access alternative to existing content.

Subtitles can always be visible (‘burnt’ in video, open caption), or they can be shown on demand (closed caption); in the latter case, make sure that the mechanism to show/hide them is easy to find and operate. Ensure that the subtitles are synchronised. Automatically generated subtitles are usually incorrect and must always be verified or revised manually.

If videos only play background music, also indicate this (e.g. ‘Relaxed background music’) so that hearing-impaired people know that they are not missing any relevant information.

### Responsibilities

- The development team creates the necessary technical requirements, such as a functionality to capture subtitles when uploading a video file, as well as the option to show/hide them.
- The content managers create and maintain the relevant content as required.
- Clients should be aware that the creation of accessible audio and video content entails additional work.

## Examples

- The spoken content of a video is made available as subtitles.
- If the person speaking is not clearly visible on the image or different speakers change in quick succession, the subtitles identify the same person or persons by name.
- Videos without speech provide an indication of the background music and/or mood.
