# ✅ Audio description or media alternative

Wcag criterion: [📜 1.2.3 Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded) - A](..)

## Description

Text transcripts or audio descriptions exist for synchronised video content (videos in which the audio and video tracks together provide the complete information). The following applies to audio description: If all the information in the video track is already contained in the audio track, no audio description is required.

Exception: If the synchronised video content is a media alternative for existing text (and clearly marked as such), then no additional text alternative or audio description is required.

(This checkpoint can be disregarded if Level AA is the target and 📜-1.2.5 therefore comes into force).

## Method

**Manual check:** Compare text transcript with video content: Is the content equivalent?
