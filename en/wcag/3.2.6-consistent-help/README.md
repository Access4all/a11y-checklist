# ðŸ“œ 3.2.6 Consistent Help - A

## Understanding (short)

**Help Instructions** must be located **in the same place** on several process steps or sub-pages. This makes it easier for users to find or request help.

## Understanding (long)

Tasks on websites can be challenging, such as completing a complex ordering process or finding a specific product in a large online store. For example, People with cognitive impairments often need help with these tasks, which can be provided by different help services.

It is important that this help is always found in the same place, especially for processes that involve several pages. For example, the hotline number could always be at the top of the page.

**Important:** This success criterion does not require help to be available. It simply requires that it (if available) is always displayed in the same place, if possible.

### Responsibilities

- The design team places help consistently and intuitively throughout the product.
- The development team correctly implements the specifications defined by the design team.

## Examples

- General contact details such as phone number, email address and opening hours, or a link to a contact form in the footer of a website.
- A live chat client in the search mask of an online shop that helps the customer to find a specific product or service.
- Self-help options, such as a link to frequently asked questions (FAQs) within an online airline ticket booking system.
