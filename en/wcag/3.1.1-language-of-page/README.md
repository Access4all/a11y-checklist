# ðŸ“œ 3.1.1 Language of Page - A

## Understanding (short)

**Websites** must have a **correct language declaration** (`long` attribute). This enables assistive devices (e.g. screen readers) to read out content with correct pronunciation.

## Understanding (long)

It is very important that the main language of a website is declared correctly. Otherwise, a screen reader would read out a German-language website in English, for example. This would make the content largely incomprehensible. Therefore, define the correct main language according to the respective language version.

The â€˜langâ€™ attribute requires an ISO language code as a value. Normally this is a two-letter code such as â€˜enâ€™ for English (`<html lang=â€˜enâ€™>`), but it can also be an extended code such as â€˜en-gbâ€™ for British English (`<html lang=â€˜en-gbâ€™>`). If the website offers several languages, update the `lang` attribute accordingly when changing the language.

### Responsibilities

- The development team sets the correct declaration for the respective language.
