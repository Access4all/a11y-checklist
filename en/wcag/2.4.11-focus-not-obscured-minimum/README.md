# ðŸ“œ 2.4.11 Focus Not Obscured (Minimum) - AA

## Understanding (short)

The **keyboard focus** should **not be covered** by other elements. This enables effortless navigation with the keyboard.

## Understanding (long)

If the currently focussed element is covered by other elements, this makes navigation using the keyboard considerably more difficult (see [ðŸ“œ-2.1.1 Keyboard](/en/wcag/2.1.1-keyboard)). This can happen, for example, if the footer area is fixed when scrolling (â€˜sticky footerâ€™) and the focussed element is at the bottom of the viewport.

Partial covering of the focus is tolerable, even if it should be avoided; complete covering is unacceptable.

**Note:** Poor focus guidance can also cause such problems, see also [ðŸ“œ-2.4.3 Focus Order](/en/wcag/2.4.3-focus-order).

### Exceptions

- Situations in which an element temporarily overlaps the surrounding content are negligible: for example, if the focus disappears behind a previously opened date selector ([âœ… Date picker / time picker](/en/wcag/4.1.2a-advanced-controls-widgets/date-picker-time-picker)). It is important that the overlapping element can be closed if required (e.g. using the `Esc` key).
- The position of some elements can be changed by the user, such as certain dialogues ([âœ… Dialogs](/en/wcag/4.1.2a-advanced-controls-widgets/dialogs)); for such elements, only the initial position must meet the requirements, i.e. directly after the dialogue appears.

### Responsibilities

- The development team positions interactive elements and scrolls the viewport so that the focus is always as visible as possible.

## âœ… Checkpoints

- [âœ… Focus visible](focus-visible)
