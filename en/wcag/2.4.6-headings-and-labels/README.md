# ðŸ“œ 2.4.6 Headings and Labels - AA

## Understanding (short)

**Headings and labels** must be **meaningful**. This enables good navigation within the content and the targeted use of the same.

## Understanding (long)

Headings must describe the corresponding web content in a sufficiently informative and correct way; this helps to differentiate and navigate the content. Common errors are, for example, buttons or headings on a page that are not very informative or have several of the same name. Please also note **ðŸ“œ-1.3.1a Headings structure** and **ðŸ“œ-2.5.3 Label in Name**.

Form elements must also be well labelled (using `<label>`, see **ðŸ“œ-1.3.1c Forms, Labels and Fieldsets**). A common error is input fields marked as mandatory with asterisk (`*`) alone (without other techniques such as the `required` attribute): this visually common convention has no meaning for assistive technologies.

**Recommendation:** If possible, avoid using the `title` attribute. This is not consistently displayed by assistive technologies (e.g. screen readers).



### External generated content

Inaccessible, externally generated content must be pointed out! For example, by placing a short (visually hidden) information directly before the corresponding content that non-accessible, externally generated content follows.

### Delimitation

- The present success criterion ensures that existing headings and labels are **meaningful**.
- It is not always necessary for headings to be **present** at all (however, headings are usually the best technique for naming and differentiating content); **ðŸ“œ-3.3.2 Labels or Instructions** requires that labels are **present** at all.
- That _headers_ are **semantically and hierarchically correctly implemented** is required by **ðŸ“œ-1.3.1a Headings structure**; that _labels_ are **semantically correctly implemented** (and thus linked to the input fields) is required by **ðŸ“œ-1.3.1c Forms, Labels and Fieldsets**.

### Responsibilities

- The design team defines meaningful names for generic headings and labels.
- The content managers label headings and labels in the content in a meaningful way.

## Examples

```html
<article>
  <h3>iPhone X</h3>
  <p>The iPhone X has the following features: ...</p>
  <button>Buy</button><!-- First "Buy" button -->
</article>

<article>
  <h3>iPhone XS</h3>
  <p>The iPhone XS...</p>
  <button>Buy</button><!-- Bad: second "Buy" button -->
</article>

<article>
  <h3>iPhone XS</h3>
  <p>The iPhone XS...</p>
  <button>
    <!-- Visually hidden (for CSS see 1.3.1a) -->
    <span class="visually-hidden">iPhone XS</span><!-- Better -->
    Buy
  </button>
</article>
```
