# 3.2.3 Consistent Navigation - AA

## Understanding (short)

The **navigation elements** must be **consistently implemented** within a website. This ensures optimal orientation and navigation.

## Understanding (long)

In order for web pages to be navigated in a predictable way, the navigation elements within a website need to be arranged and structured in a consistent way. This is particularly important for people with cognitive disabilities.

Therefore, you should ensure that navigation is offered consistently on different pages. For example, the search function should always be in the same place. Changes should only be made if explicitly requested by the user: for example, if the submenu is expanded by interacting with a top menu.

### Responsibilities

- The design team defines navigation elements that look and behave consistently.
- The development team correctly implements the specifications defined by the design team.
