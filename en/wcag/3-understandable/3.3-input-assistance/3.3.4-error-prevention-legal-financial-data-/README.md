# 3.3.4 Error Prevention (Legal, Financial, Data) - AA

## Understanding (short)

**Before completing processes** with legal or financial consequences (such as online shopping), it must be possible for users to **check** and, if necessary, **correct** their entries. This enables incorrect entries to be recognized and avoided.

## Understanding (long)

Entries that have legal or financial consequences (such as the checkout process in an online store, registering for an online service or completing a questionnaire test) must be able to be checked, changed or deleted before the final submission. Therefore, make sure that users have the opportunity to check and, if necessary, correct the data they have entered before final completion.

This condition is often fulfilled by displaying a summary of all relevant data as the last step in a process (e.g. a list of the items to be ordered, the price to be paid, the payment method, delivery address, etc.). This allows this data to be checked clearly; it must also be possible to make subsequent changes. The process is only completed after confirmation (e.g. a “Send order definitively” button).

### Responsibilities

- The design team defines sensible process steps that enable the final check and correction of entered data and their final confirmation.

## Examples

Before an order is sent in the online store, a confirmation page with the entire order and the customer data is displayed. The “Edit” button can be used to go back through the order process and edit it again, while “Submit order” triggers the order process with all its consequences.
