# 3.3.7 Redundant Entry - A

## Understanding (short)

Users should not have to enter **personal data multiple times**. This reduces the effort for cognitively impaired people.

## Understanding (long)

Some people find it difficult to store information in their short-term memory. Having to enter the same information at different points in a process can be a significant cognitive load. For example, when you have to enter the same address twice in an online shop as a delivery address and a billing address. This also increases the likelihood of input errors.

Previously entered user data must therefore be made available for selection in a subsequent process step during the same session: for example, via a checkbox "Use delivery address as billing address". This success criterion also applies across different providers within a process, e.g. when switching to a payment provider during checkout in an online shop.

**Note:** This success criterion does not apply to multiple sessions, nor does it apply to password entry, see also **ðŸ“œ-3.3.8 Accessible Authentication (Minimum)**.

### Exceptions

- If the repeated input is essential for the purpose of the input, such as entering the same password twice when creating a login (to avoid careless mistakes), or entering an answer in a quiz game.
- If the previously entered information is no longer valid, the user may be prompted to re-enter this information.

### Responsibilities

- The design team provides ways to easily re-use personal information that has already been entered.
- The development team correctly implements the specifications defined by the design team.

## Examples

- An online shop offers previously entered addresses for selection via a drop-down list.
- The search results page immediately fills the search field with the previously entered search term.
