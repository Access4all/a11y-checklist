# ðŸ“œ 1.4.2 Audio Control - A

## Understanding (short)

**Automatically playing audio content** must either **stop** after three seconds or it must be possible to stop it manually. This enables undisturbed use of the content.

## Understanding (long)

Automatic playback of audio content can be very distracting. It can interfere with the output of assistive devices that also use the auditory channel (such as screen readers) or distract people with attention deficits. It must therefore be possible to pause, stop or mute such content.

**Important:** The auditory channel is essential for the use of a screen reader. Even if the automatic playback of audio content on a website can in theory be stopped by pressing a button, the button must first be found. If the audio is too loud or distracting, this may not be possible. We therefore strongly recommend that you avoid automatically playing audio content in general.

### Responsibilities

- The design team defines appropriate controls for pausing/stopping content that plays audio automatically.
- The development team correctly implements the specifications defined by the design team.
- Clients should be aware that automatically playing audio content can be very disruptive to people with disabilities.

## Examples

Control buttons (play, stop, etc.) are available.
