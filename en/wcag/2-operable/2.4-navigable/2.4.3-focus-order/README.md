# 2.4.3 Focus Order - A

## Understanding (short)

**Focusable elements** must be lined up in a **meaningful sequence** and the **focus** must be **meaningfully guided**. This enables people who only use a keyboard to navigate intuitively and quickly between these elements and interact with them.

## Understanding (long)

People who interact with a website using the keyboard move their focus through the interactive elements in their sequential order (see ðŸ“œ-2.1.1). Make sure that the order of the focus is intuitive and that the focus jumps from element to element in a comprehensible way (according to the visual arrangement) when tabbing through the individual elements.

Normally, the arrangement of the elements in the DOM determines the order (see ðŸ“œ-1.3.2). If this is to be overridden, the `tabindex` attribute can be used, but this is generally not recommended.

Also make it easier to navigate using the keyboard by intelligently guiding the focus (e.g. via JavaScript or `autofocus` attribute). For example, when opening a modal dialog (âœ…-103), set the focus directly into it; prevent it from jumping back into the darkened background; and set the focus back to the previous element when the dialog is closed. Be careful, however, that no keyboard trap occurs (see ðŸ“œ-2.1.2).

Focus guidance can also be appropriate in forms. For example, when submitting an incorrectly completed form, place the focus directly on the first incorrect input field (see ðŸ“œ-3.3.1). As a guideline: what does the user want to interact with next?

Also avoid the focus being visually "lost" (e.g. because invisible elements can be focused, see also ðŸ“œ-2.4.11) or unexpectedly being reset to the top of the page (e.g. because the previously focused element was suddenly removed from the DOM).

### Responsibilities

- The development team arranges all the elements on the page as expected and sensibly guides the focus of the interactive elements.

### Delimitation

- This success criterion ensures that **manual overriding** of the DOM sequence for the focus sequence makes sense.
- That the DOM order be **meaningful in itself** is required by ðŸ“œ-1.3.2.
