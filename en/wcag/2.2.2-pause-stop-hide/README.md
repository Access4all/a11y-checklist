# ðŸ“œ 2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide - A

## Understanding (short)

It must be possible **to stop or hide** **moving, flashing** or other** changing content** (such as adverts). This enables people who are distracted by it (e.g. with attention deficits) to use content without interference.

## Understanding (long)

Permanently animated elements (such as advertising banners) require additional attention. This can hinder people with limited cognitive performance from focussing on other content on the same page. As a result, such pages quickly become completely unusable. It must therefore be possible to pause, stop or hide such elements. This also applies to functions that update automatically (such as a news ticker).

**Exceptions:** If the movement is an animation that runs to indicate that something is loading (a â€˜spinnerâ€™); or if the animation lasts no longer than 5 seconds.

**Note:** For requirements related to flickering or flashing content, see [ðŸ“œ-2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold](/en/wcag/2.3.1-three-flashes-or-below-threshold).

### Responsibilities

- The design team defines easy-to-perceive and easy-to-use options for pausing, stopping or fading out animations.
- The development team correctly implements the specifications defined by the design team.
- Clients should be aware that animations can be an unnecessary distraction for everyone.

## Examples

- A news ticker that reloads its content every few seconds to display the latest news has a pause button.
- A banner advert that constantly scrolls text horizontally across the screen has a pause button.
- A carousel that automatically displays a different slide every few seconds has a pause button (or stops changing automatically as soon as â€˜Next slideâ€™ is clicked, for example).
- A â€˜Special offer!â€™ link flashes rhythmically or changes colour regularly.
- An animation that plays automatically (e.g. an advertising video) can be paused (or lasts no longer than 5 seconds).
